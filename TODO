1. Make a hashmap with keys of usernames and values of true if we'eve read there skin.
Currently I am just setting a global boolean if we read one skin and thats it, this hashmap
will let us read skins from multiple users.

2. In the above hashmap, change the value of true to be a md5sum of their skin, so we can detect if the skin 
has changed and read it again. 

3. Make a command that the user can do like /send <message> that will call the LSB encoding to write that message to
their skin and then upload that skin to minecraft for them.
